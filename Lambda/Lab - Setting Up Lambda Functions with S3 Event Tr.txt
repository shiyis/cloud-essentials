Lab - Setting Up Lambda Functions with S3 Event Triggers 

Step 1 : Create an IAM Role for Lambda with the permission below: 

 

Create an SNS Topic and Subscribe to Your Email Address to It 

Create an SNS topic 

Subscribe to your email  

To confirm the subscription, access the email previously used, open the SNS email, and click Confirm subscription. 

Create a Lambda Function 

Create a Lambda function with the Role you have created. Below is the code: (Code is compiling but now sending email to SNS. I want to show you how to debug lambda. You have to fix code) 

import json 

import boto3 

  

def lambda_handler(event, context): 

    client = boto3.client('sns') 

  

    try: 

        size = event['Records'][0]['s3']['object']['size'] 

    except KeyError: 

        pass 

    bucket = event['Records'][0]['s3']['bucket']['name'] 

    key = event['Records'][0]['s3']['object']['key'] 

    if event['Records'][0]['eventName'] == "ObjectRemoved:Delete": 

        payload_str = "An object with name: " + key + " was deleted from bucket: " + bucket 

    else: 

        payload_str = "An object with name " + key + " and size "+ str(size) + "B was uploaded to bucket: " + bucket 

  

    print(payload_str) 

    response = client.publish(TargetArn='<<ARN of your SNS topic>>',Subject='My Lambda S3 event',Message=json.dumps({'default': json.dumps(payload_str)}), 

    MessageStructure='json') 

 

Create S3 bucket and setup “Event” from properties for all kinds of S3 operation. 

Make sure you have integrated proper Lambda to S3 


⭐ AWS CLI - create s3 bucket, upload files, delete file

aws s3 mb s3://bucket-name --region region

aws s3 rb s3://bucket-name --force

aws s3api delete-objects --bucket bucket-name --delete "$(aws s3api list-object-version --bucket bucket-name --output=json --query='{Objects: Versions[].{Key:Key,VersionId:VersionId}}')"


⭐ AWS CLI - Create EC2 instance and delete
